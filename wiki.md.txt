![https://www.businessinsider.com/what-life-is-like-in-kivalina-alaska-2017-9]

Kivalina, Alaska is a barrier island situated above the Arctic circle, framed by the Chukchi Sea to the west and the Kivalina Lagoon, Wulik River and Alaskan tundra to the east. It is home to ~500 residents, most of who are Inupiaq Alaska Natives. Subsistence hunting is still widely practiced in the village, with ugruk (bearded seals), tuttu (caribou), and various birds and fish composing most of hunters' take. 

## Climate Change in Kivalina
Because of its unique position, Kivalina is facing significant challenges due to climate change. These challenges include increased storm frequency and intensity, unreliable sea ice freeze-up and thaw, melting permafrost, altered timing of subsistence animal migrations, and coastal subsidence among others.

### Ongoing Research + Opportunities
As part of an ongoing collaboration between Kivalina Search and Rescue volunteers and University of Washington researchers [https://www.kvlseaice.org/], local observations and satellite data have informed localized sea ice forecasts. While these forecasts are meant to assist Kivalina hunters to assess conditions and travel more safely, they do not account for past Search and Rescue incidents or areas of higher climate-related hazards.

## Project Goals
This project seeks to **identify and map climate risks related to human safety and food systems in Kivalina** through the foregrounding of local hunter, Search and Rescue volunteer, and Elder stories. The project will take the form of a story map, which will spatialize and visualize recent Search and Rescue incidents as well as preserve local place names. 

### Future Directions
The story map will function as a living site to be turned over to Kivalina residents to add to and edit as they see fit. It will also serve as a proof of concept for a larger project requested by the City Administrator, Colleen Swan: a digital cultural archive of Elder stories.
